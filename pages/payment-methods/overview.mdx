## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Start with PIX
Begin with PIX for the best customer experience:

```javascript
const charge = await debita.charges.create({
  customer_id: 'cus_123',
  amount: 5000, // R$ 50,00
  currency: 'BRL',
  payment_method: ['pix'],
  description: 'Premium subscription'
});
```

### 2. Add Boleto for Coverage
Include Boleto for customers who prefer traditional methods:

```javascript
const charge = await debita.charges.create({
  customer_id: 'cus_123',
  amount: 15000, // R$ 150,00
  currency: 'BRL',
  payment_method: ['pix', 'boleto'],
  description: 'Annual subscription'
});
```

### 3. Enable Both Methods
For maximum conversion, enable PIX and Boleto:

```javascript
const charge = await debita.charges.create({
  customer_id: 'cus_123',
  amount: 25000, // R$ 250,00
  currency: 'BRL',
  payment_method: ['pix', 'boleto'],
  description: 'Premium package'
});
```
